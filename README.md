Back in 2022, I created a website that I was really proud of. Recently, I decided to revisit some of the old code because I’ve developed a newfound interest in coding. It’s fascinating to look back at my previous work and see how much I’ve grown. I’m excited to dive back into this project, improve it with new techniques I’ve learned, and continue exploring the world of coding.
