                <p>As of 2022 Jerome is a thriving tourist and artist hub with a population of around 450 people. Jerome resides above what was once the largest copper mine in Arizona. Men and women from all over the world made their way to Arizona to find work and perhaps a new way of life. Today the mines may be silent, but Jerome has found new life as the largest ghost town in America.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <div class="brief-text">
                <p>1875, the first mining claims and a mill site were located near the present site of the Town of Jerome at the base of two large cone-shaped hills, later called Cleopatra Hill and Woodchute Mountain. These claims were purchased by the United Verde Copper Company, organized by Frederick Tritle. The camp was named Jerome for Eugene Jerome, a major financier of the United Verde Copper Company. A small blast furnace was hauled in by wagon, and copper was produced in 1883 and 1884. By 1887, the operation closed, and in 1888, William Clark bought a majority of the stock and developed the operations into a profitable business. The small blast furnace produced nearly $1 million in copper and is on display today in Jerome. In the image above you can see the iconic J above Jerome that can be seen to this very day.</p>
